# RSSFeedAggregator

An RSS Feed Aggregator I made for my term project in my Grade 12 Computer Science Class. 

This project was made using **Java Swing**

**How It Works**

You put in an RSS Feed of your choice. It then stores the feed and articles into an SQLite Database.

It then fetches this from the database and displays it on the front-end sorts the article from newest to oldest. 

If an panel for the article has a thick black border it means you have not read this article. If it is a normal black border it means you have.

Click on an article to read it and it will open up in your in-app reader. **Some articles or channels such as CNN don't work 
as the JEditorPane isn't very good at supporting HTML**

You can also read the article in your default browser or in a new window.

You can add multiple channels and see which ones you have subscribed to.
